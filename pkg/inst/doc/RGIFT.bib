abstract = { Package exams provides a framework for automatic generation of standardized statistical exams which is especially useful for large-scale exams. To employ the tools, users just need to supply a pool of exercises and a master file controlling the layout of the final PDF document. The exercises are specified in separate Sweave files (containing R code for data generation and LaTeX code for problem and solution description) and the master file is a LaTeX document with some additional control commands. This paper gives an overview of the main design aims and principles as well as strategies for adaptation and extension. Hands-on illustrations---based on example exercises and control files provided in the package---are presented to get new users started easily.},
