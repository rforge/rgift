\usage{
GIFTMC(qtxt, anstxt, rightans=1, wright=NULL, wwrong=NULL, MAnswer=FALSE)
}

\item{qtxt}{Text of the question.}
\item{anstxt}{Vector of short answers.}
\item{rightans}{Position of right answers in anstxt.}
\item{wright}{Vector of weights for the right answer.}
\item{wwrong}{Vector of weights for the wrong answers.}
\item{MAnswer}{Are multiple answers valid?}
}

\details{
These functions use the \code{cat()} function to print a Multiple
Choice Question
in the GIFT format. In this questions, the user is asked to select one or
more answers.  Use of the \code{sink()} function is adviced to send the ouput to a text
file.

If MAnswer is true the length of anstxt and wright must be the same. In
addition, it one of the elements in wright is "100" then only one answer
can be chosen. Otherwise, the user can select several right answers (in
this case remember to use negative weights for the wrong answers!).
